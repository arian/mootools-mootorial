To fix links:
* search for [[ and replace with [ but be careful of examples with nested arrays
* search for ]] and replace with ) "
* search for | and replace with ](
* this will only fix external links

Watch for:
* javascript, Javascript > JavaScript
* acronyms that aren't capitalized (ajax > AJAX)
* first person "I" should change to 1st person plural "we"; search for "me " and "I "
* check external links to ensure they are still valid
* look for more recent content on the web to link to
* wrap references to methods and other code in back-ticks "`" so markdown can show these as fixed-width blocks
* it's > its (where applicable) as the original author [that's-a-me!] often gets that shit mixed up
* remove all the <code> wrappers and indent codeblocks
* update examples with older doctypes to have an HTML5 doctype: `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`

Questions:
* how do I embed a runnable code sample?
* how do I link to a page? how do deep link to a specific section of a page
