Learning Javascript
-------------------

There's a nice [[http://blog.mootools.net/2007/6/5/help-i-dont-know-javascript|roundup of Javascript resources]] at the [[http://blog.mootools.net|MooTools Blog]]. I recommend the following strongly:

  * [[http://video.yahoo.com/search/?p=douglas+crockford+javascript+programming+language|Douglas Crockford: The Javascript Programming Language]] - These four videos are a must-watch. If you're new to javascript or are rusty, start here.
  * [[http://video.yahoo.com/search?p=douglas+crockford+advanced+javascript&x=0&y=0|Dougals Crockford: Advanced Javascript]] - These are a little less useful but still very informative. They are less useful because MooTools creates a different kind of environment than Douglas is describing (he talks about native Javascript, and MooTools kind of changes this native environment and so many of his code examples don't apply to MooTools, but you can still learn from them).
  * [[http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0WTQ1d1bW1G8iMBoSYCP88F;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHZkMjZyBHBvcwMxBHNlYwNzcg--/SIG=122e20mkk/EXP=1181662965/**http%3A//video.yahoo.com/video/play%3Fvid=111597|Joe Hewitt presents Firebug]] - this video will introduce you to [[http://getfirebug.com|Firebug]], a must-have debugging tool if you're doing any javascript work (actually, if you're doing any html, css, javascript, ajax, whatever; it's awesome).
  * [[http://w3schools.com/js/default.asp|w3schools js docs and tutorials]]  - a good place to learn how to use various native functions.
