Write your code!
----------------

That's where this Mootorial can help you. If you read these pages (I recommend reading them in order) you should learn how each function and class in MooTools works. Refer to [[http://docs.mootools.net|the docs]] for reference and don't be afraid to look at the source code of MooTools to see how it works.

You need to use things like the [[mootorial:05-utilities:01-domready|domready.js]] event to run your code after the html is loaded and use [[02-class]] to create reusable code. You can also read [[09-howtowriteamootoolsclass|this tutorial on how to write a MooTools Class]].
