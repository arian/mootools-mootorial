Downloading MooTools
--------------------

Downloading MooTools is pretty easy. You just go to [[http://www.mootools.net/download|the download page]] and select which portions of the library you want to download. 

I recommend downloading the version that is not compressed and contains the docs for learning and development. This way if you get an error you can view the source and see what's going on. The compressed version is all on a single line and debugging when using it is very frustrating. When you're finished writing your code, download the compressed version, or compress it yourself with [[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/]].
