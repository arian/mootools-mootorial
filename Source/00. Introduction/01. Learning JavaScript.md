Learning Javascript
-------------------

There's a nice [http://blog.mootools.net/2007/6/5/help-i-dont-know-javascript](roundup of Javascript resources) at the [http://blog.mootools.net](MooTools Blog). We highly recommend the following:

  * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook](Douglas Crockford - Javascript: The Good Parts) (youtube)
  * [http://www.clientcide.com/best-practices/my-talk-at-jsconf-programming-to-patterns/](Aaron Newton - Programming to Patterns) - An overview of using MooTools' Class architecture in your code.
  * [http://yuilibrary.com/theater/douglas-crockford/crockford-tjpl/](Douglas Crockford - The Javascript Programming Language) - These four videos are a must-watch. If you're new to javascript or are rusty, start here.
  * [http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/27/video-crockford-advjs/](Dougals Crockford -  Advanced Javascript) - These are a little less useful but still very informative. They are less useful because MooTools creates a different kind of environment than Douglas is describing (he talks about native Javascript, and MooTools kind of changes this native environment and so many of his code examples don't apply to MooTools, but you can still learn from them).
  * [http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/10/20/video-crockford-domtheory/](Douglas Crockford - Dom Theory) - A good overview of the DOM and it's messy API.
  * [http://w3schools.com/js/default.asp](w3schools js docs and tutorials)  - a good place to learn how to use various native functions.
