Write your code!
----------------

That's where this Mootorial can help you. If you read these pages (we recommend reading them in order) you should learn how each function and class in MooTools works. Refer to [http://docs.mootools.net](the docs) for reference and don't be afraid to look at the source code of MooTools to see how it works.

You need to use things like the [../19.+Utilities/00.+Utilities.md#TODO](domready.js) event to run your code after the HTML is loaded and use [../02.+Class/Class.md](Class) to create reusable code. You can also read [this tutorial on how to write a MooTools Class](TODO).
