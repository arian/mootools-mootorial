Adding MooTools to your pages
-----------------------------

Just create a `<script>` tag in the head of your document that points to your copy of MooTools. After this tag add another one that either points to an external file with your own javascript that uses MooTools, or write it inline:

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
      <title>Your title</title>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="mootools.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="yourSiteCode.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        //or write some code in-line
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>....</body>
  </html>

We recommend that you have your code in an external file, but where you put it is up to you.
