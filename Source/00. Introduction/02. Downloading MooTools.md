Downloading MooTools
==================================

Downloading MooTools is pretty easy. You just go to [http://www.mootools.net/download](the download page) and select which version of the library you want to download. If you'd like to make your own version with just the portions that you want, [http://mootools.net/core/](visit the builder for MooTools Core) and select which components you want.

We recommend downloading the version that is not compressed and contains the docs for learning and development. This way if you get an error you can view the source and see what's going on. The compressed version is all on a single line and debugging when using it is very frustrating. When you're finished writing your code, download the compressed version, or compress it yourself with [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/]().

MooTools More
-------------

MooTools includes its own set of official plugins called "MooTools More." These plugins aren't part of MooTools Core because they aren't as universally used. While AJAX requests are a mainstay of nearly every application (and thus MooTools provides AJAX functionality with its Request class), things like form validation or accordions are not. Items like this are provided by the [MooTools More builder](http://mootools.net/more/). If you have [MooTools Core installed on your pages](03. Adding MooTools to your pages.md) then anything in More should work.
